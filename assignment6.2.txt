Give brief answers to the questions below:



 1. Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?

  * It is needed when the  job requires optimization at the  stage of processing .

  * It is required when  the job has usage of cross products,distributed cache and joins.

  * Hadoop developers use MapReduce when good amount of testability is required for combining  large sets of data .
   


2. What are advantages of Pig over MapReduce?

  The advantages of Pig over MapReduce are :
  
  * Pig has a decrease in development time . 
  
  * Learning is easy . Anyone with no knowledge of vanilla map-reduce or SQL can write map-reduce jobs .

  * Pig is procedural and not declarative . So, it is easier to follow the commands . It is much like an english language .
  
  * It is a high level language while map reduce is low level .

  * Pig uses multi-query reducing length of code .

  * No need of compilation in Pig .



3. What is Pig engine and what is its importance?
  
  * Pig engine acts as interpreter between Pig latin script and map reduce Jobs .
  
  * It creates an environment to execute Pig scripts into series of map reduce jobs in parallel .

  * Pig can handle very large amount of data sets as it open to substantial parallelisation . 


4. What are the modes of Pig execution?

  The main modes in Pig Execution are :
 
  -Local Mode 
  -MapReduce Mode 

 Local Mode :
 * All files are installed and run from local host and file system .

 * This is used for testing .

 MapReduce Mode :
 * It is where we load or process data that exists in HDFS .

 * Whenecer we execute Pig Latin statements to process data MapReduce job is invoked in back end . 


5. What is Grunt Shell in Pig?

  * The grunt shell of Apache Pig is used to write Pig latin scripts .

  * The grunt shell provides set of utility commands such as clear , help , quit , set and history .

  
6. What are the features of Pig Latin language?

  * With Pig latin , programmers can perform Map Reduce tasks without complex codes in java . 
 
  * Pig latin is SQL like language and is easy to learn . 

   * The key properties of Pig Latin are - 

  - Ease of programming 

  - Optimization oppurtunities 

  _ Extensibility 


7. Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive?

 * The name of relations and fields are case sensitive .

 * The function names are case sensitive .
 
 * But , the name of parameters and pig latin keywords are case insensitive .


8. What is a data flow language? 

 * Data flow programming models a program as directed graph of data flow between operations . 

 * In data flow you have a stream of data which is passed from instruction to instruction to be processed .
